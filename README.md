# Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR-Clustering-and-Dimensionality-Reduction
This repository explores clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques on the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The goal is to identify distinct activity groups within the sensor data and visualize the results in a reduced-dimensional space.
